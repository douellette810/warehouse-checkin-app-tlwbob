[{"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Create a \"Warehouse Check-In\" app where users log material received by customer. The app is based on a form which is normally filled in by employees. The app should take each step of the form and walk the employee through each step, not allowing them to proceed until the previous step is finished. So each section from the form which required information to be filled in should provide the user with either a drop-down selection, or dialog box depending on what I specify using *DD* for drop-down, and *DB* for dialog box. The selections in the drop-down should only be able to be edited by admins, and the dialog boxes should have no character restrictions. Additionally, some information like company address and contact person should be autofilled based on previously stored information provided by admin when adding customer/company information. This will be noted by *AF* for autofill. The form has a section at the top to fill in the following information: \"Employee Name\" *DD*, \"Date\" *DD*, \"Time\" *DD*, \"Total Time Out and Back (Hrs.)\" *DD*, \"Company of Origin\" *DD*, \"Address\" *AF*, \"Contact Person\" *AF*, \"Email\" *AF*, and \"Phone\" *AF*. The next section is labeled, \"Total Quantity for Certificate of Destruction by Category\". This step should show at least two drop-downs for \"Category\" *DD* and \"Quantity\" *DD* in a table format with the option to add more as needed.  When the information is done being entered, all the Quantities from each Category should be totaled. The next section is titled, \"Material Received:\" and this step should take the user through a series of questions about the materials received. The number of questions will be based on the number of \"Value Materials\" the admin adds to the backend database. For each Value Material entered into the database named, \"X\", the user should be asked, \"Did you receive any X in bulk quantity or pre-sorted?\" and given a yes/no bubble selection. If the answer is yes, then they will be presented with a dialog box to enter the \"Quantity\" of \"X\". The quantity they enter should be automatically appended with a suffix like \"Lbs.\" or \"Pcs.\". The suffixes should be entered by the admin at the time the material is added to the database and the title for the \"Suffix\" *DD* should be \"Meas.\" for measurement type. If the answer to the user's question was no, the user should be presented with the next value material in question until they reach the end of the list. Next, the user should be asked, in the same manner, about \"Charge Materials\", which will have also been added to the database by admin in the same way as before. When the user finishes these questions they should be given a prompt asking, \"Is there anything else of suspected value in this load?\" with a yes/no bubble. If yes, they should be given a *DB* to enter their note. If no, proceed to the next question \"Other notes / Damages?\" with another yes/no and *DB* if answered yes. When this is completed, the user should be given a chance to review their inputs on one screen which will basically re-create the form in it's entirety and ask them to confirm, or if they wish to edit. Each section should have an edit button during the review. If they confirm then the results should be saved and kept in the database under the customer name, where it can be pulled up for later review or printed.

You want a \"Warehouse Check-In\" app for logging material received, guiding employees through a form-like process with drop-downs, dialog boxes, and autofilled information. Here's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n-   **Guided Form Flow:** Implement the step-by-step form process, ensuring users complete each section before moving on. This includes the initial information section, the \"Total Quantity for Certificate of Destruction\" section, and the \"Material Received\" questions.\n-   **Dynamic Questions Based on Database:** Connect the app to the Supabase database to dynamically generate questions about \"Value Materials\" and \"Charge Materials\" based on admin input.\n-   **Review and Submission:** Create a review screen where users can see all their inputs, edit sections, and confirm submission. Data should be saved to the Supabase database under the customer name.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n-   **Colors:**\n    -   Background: `#F5F5F5` (Light gray for a clean look)\n    -   Text: `#333333` (Dark gray for readability)\n    -   TextSecondary: `#666666` (Medium gray for less important text)\n    -   Primary: `#2196F3` (Blue for main interactive elements)\n    -   Secondary: `#F44336` (Red for errors or important alerts)\n    -   Accent: `#FFC107` (Amber for highlights and accents)\n    -   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White for content containers)\n    -   Highlight: `#BBDEFB` (Light blue for selected items)\n-   **Typography:** Use a modern, clean font like \"System\" for a native look and feel.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Set up Supabase:** The user needs to enable Supabase by pressing the Supabase button and connecting to a project.\n2.  **File Structure:** I will need to modify the `app/(tabs)` folder to implement the changes and make the changes visible for the user.\n3.  **Implement the UI:** Create the UI components for each section of the form, including drop-downs, dialog boxes, and autofilled fields.\n4.  **Connect to Supabase:** Fetch data from Supabase to populate drop-down options and autofill fields.\n5.  **Implement Form Logic:** Implement the logic to guide users through the form, validate inputs, and save data to Supabase.\n6.  **Create Review Screen:** Create the review screen with edit functionality.\n\nNow, I will instruct the coding agent to implement the plan. After that, the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx should be removed.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-12-08T20:23:01.004511"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create a \"Warehouse Check-In\" app with a guided form flow.

I've successfully implemented the feature to total the amounts of Value and Charge Materials with separate totals for different units of measurement. Here's what I've done:\n\n## Changes Made:\n\n### 1. **Updated Type Definitions** (`types/checkIn.ts`)\n- Added a new `MaterialTotal` interface to store totals by measurement unit\n- Added `valueMaterialsTotals` and `chargeMaterialsTotals` arrays to the `CheckInFormData` type\n\n### 2. **Enhanced MaterialsStep Component** (`components/checkIn/MaterialsStep.tsx`)\n- Added a `calculateTotals()` function that groups materials by their measurement units and sums the quantities\n- Added an `updateTotals()` function that recalculates totals whenever materials are added\n- The totals are now displayed in real-time in the \"Materials Received So Far\" summary card\n- Each unit of measurement gets its own total (e.g., \"150 Lbs.\", \"25 Pcs.\", etc.)\n\n### 3. **Enhanced ReviewStep Component** (`components/checkIn/ReviewStep.tsx`)\n- Added a dedicated \"Totals by Unit\" section for both Value and Charge Materials\n- The totals are displayed in a highlighted section with distinct styling\n- Each measurement unit shows its total in a clear, easy-to-read format\n\n### 4. **Updated Main Form** (`app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`)\n- Initialized the new `valueMaterialsTotals` and `chargeMaterialsTotals` arrays in the form state\n- Updated the form submission to include these totals in the database\n\n## Key Features:\n\n- **Automatic Calculation**: Totals are calculated automatically as materials are added\n- **Unit Separation**: Each unit of measurement (Lbs., Pcs., etc.) gets its own total\n- **Real-time Display**: Totals are shown during material entry and in the final review\n- **Visual Distinction**: Totals are highlighted with special styling to make them stand out\n- **Database Storage**: Totals are saved with the check-in record for future reference\n\nThe feature now properly aggregates materials by their units of measurement, so if you have multiple materials measured in \"Lbs.\", they'll all be summed together, and materials measured in \"Pcs.\" will have their own separate total."}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "commit", "commit_id": "7e15317b4711058bf1ea54ee283c19921d560cbe", "message": "feat: Add totals for value/charge materials grouped by unit", "timestamp": "2025-12-08T20:54:25Z", "files_changed": ["components/checkIn/ReviewStep.tsx", "app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx", "types/checkIn.ts", "components/checkIn/MaterialsStep.tsx"], "update_number": 4, "parent_commit_id": "afa0dde7e346c412812c20b40e2f44b95604c9c0"}], "timestamp": "2025-12-08T20:50:05Z"}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Now, I can see the stored check-in both in the back-end and in the Admin panel, but when I click on it, it should open up the check-in in it's final form, and instead it does nothing.

Here's a plan to address the issues with displaying and securing stored check-in data:\n\n1.  **Implement Check-In Display:** Modify the Admin panel to properly display the selected check-in in its final form. This likely involves creating a dedicated \"Check-In Details\" screen or modal that receives the check-in data as a parameter and renders it in a read-only format. The navigation logic in the Admin panel needs to be updated to pass the correct check-in data to this screen.\n\n2.  **Restrict Access to Check-In Data:** Implement one of the following strategies to prevent unauthorized access or deletion of check-in records:\n\n    *   **Separate Restricted Area:** Create a new Supabase table specifically for storing completed check-ins. Configure Row Level Security (RLS) on this table to restrict access to only authorized personnel (e.g., admins). The existing table could be used as a staging area, and data would be moved to the restricted table upon final submission.\n    *   **Remove Delete Functionality:** Disable or remove the delete button/functionality from the Admin panel for check-in records. This can be achieved by modifying the UI and adjusting the Supabase client calls to prevent deletion. Additionally, RLS policies can be implemented to prevent non-admin users from deleting records, providing a backend safeguard.\n\nLet me know which approach you'd prefer for restricting access, or if you have any other ideas.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-12-08T20:57:26.479181"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you implement the ability to view stored check-ins and secure them properly.

Please try again.\") and allow the user to retry.\n    *   **Disable the Submit Button:** Disable the \"Submit Check-In\" button immediately after it's pressed to prevent multiple submissions while the process is running. Re-enable it only if the submission fails.\n    *   **Database Confirmation:** After saving the check-in data to the database, query the database to confirm that the record was successfully created.

`charge_materials` table.\n    *   Add specific headings to steps 3 and 4 as you described.\n3.  **New Step for i-Series/Ryzen:**\n    *   Add a new step after step 4 with yes/no questions for \"i-Series or Ryzen PCs?\" and \"i-Series or Ryzen Laptops?\".\n    *   If yes, present dropdowns populated from a new `I-Series` database table with \"Processor Series\" and \"Processor Generation\" columns.\n4.  **\"Additional Notes\" Step Update:**\n    *   Modify the \"Additional Notes\" step (now step 6) with updated questions as specified.\n5.  **Homepage with Admin/Check-in Options:**\n    *   Create a homepage with options to enter either the Check-in section or the Admin section.\n    *   Implement password protection for the Admin section (default username: \"admin\", default password: \"password\").\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-12-08T22:20:39.089436"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you implement

Now let me create a summary document for you:\n\n## Summary of Changes\n\nI've successfully implemented all the requested changes to your Warehouse Check-In app:\n\n### 1. **Database Changes**\n- \u2705 Renamed `value_materials` table to `value_scrap`\n- \u2705 Created new `i_series` table with processor series and generation columns\n- \u2705 Updated `check_ins` table to include i-Series data columns\n- \u2705 Pre-populated i-Series table with all combinations of processor series (i3, i5, i7, Ryzen 3, Ryzen 5, Ryzen 7) and generations (6th-14th, N/A)\n\n### 2. **Steps 3 & 4 Redesign**\n- \u2705 **Step 3 (Value Scrap)**: Now uses a data input section similar to step 2 with the heading \"Please only add materials here that are either received in pre-sorted, bulk quantities or are being purchased directly from the vendor\"\n- \u2705 **Step 4 (Charge Materials)**: Similar data input section with heading \"Please add charge materials, including mixed electronics not entered in previous step\"\n- \u2705 Both steps allow adding multiple materials with dropdowns populated from their respective database tables\n\n### 3. **New i-Series/Ryzen Step (Step 5)**\n- \u2705 Added new step after charge materials with two yes/no questions:\n  - \"Does the load contain any i-Series or Ryzen PCs?\"\n  - \"Does the load contain any i-Series or Ryzen Laptops?\"\n- \u2705 If yes to either, presents dropdown inputs for:\n  - Processor Series (i3, i5, i7, Ryzen 3, Ryzen 5, Ryzen 7)\n  - Processor Generation (6th-14th, N/A)\n  - Quantity\n- \u2705 Allows adding multiple entries for each type\n\n### 4. **Additional Notes Step Updates (Now Step 6)**\n- \u2705 Updated first question to: \"Is there anything else of suspected value in this load? (e.g. Test Equipment, Newer Servers (DDR4), Newer Devices, etc.)\"\n- \u2705 Updated second question to: \"Other Notes / Damages / Customer Requests?\"\n\n### 5. **Homepage with Authentication**\n- \u2705 Created new homepage with two options:\n  - **Check-In**: Starts a new check-in form\n  - **Admin**: Opens admin panel (password protected)\n- \u2705 Admin login with default credentials:\n  - Username: `admin`\n  - Password: `password`\n- \u2705 Removed the Check-In/Admin switch from the bottom of each page\n\n### 6. **Updated Components**\n- \u2705 Created `ValueScrapStep.tsx` - handles value scrap input\n- \u2705 Created `ChargeMaterialsStep.tsx` - handles charge materials input\n- \u2705 Created `ISeriesStep.tsx` - handles i-Series/Ryzen processor input\n- \u2705 Updated `AdditionalNotesStep.tsx` - new question text\n- \u2705 Updated `ReviewStep.tsx` - displays all new data including i-Series section\n- \u2705 Updated `types/checkIn.ts` - added new interfaces and renamed fields\n- \u2705 Updated admin panel - now includes i-Series tab and renamed Value Scrap tab\n\n### 7. **Navigation Flow**\nThe new flow is now:\n1. **Homepage** \u2192 Choose Check-In or Admin\n2. **Step 1**: Basic Information\n3. **Step 2**: Certificate of Destruction\n4. **Step 3**: Value Scrap (new format)\n5. **Step 4**: Charge Materials (new format)\n6. **Step 5**: i-Series / Ryzen (NEW)\n7. **Step 6**: Additional Notes (updated questions)\n8. **Step 7**: Review & Submit\n\nAll changes have been implemented and the app is ready to use!

The profile page has been updated to:\n- Default to the \"Check-Ins\" tab when opened (changed from \"employees\" to \"check-ins\")\n- Display a clear header: \"Admin Panel - Manage warehouse data and view check-ins\"\n- Show the check-ins tab first with a count of total check-ins\n\n### 2. **Print/Share Functionality Added**\nI've implemented comprehensive print/share functionality:\n\n**Individual Check-In Sharing:**\n- When viewing a check-in detail, there's now a \"Share / Print This Check-In\" button at the bottom\n- Generates a formatted text report with all check-in details\n- Uses the native share dialog to allow printing, emailing, or saving to files\n\n**Bulk Check-In Sharing:**\n- Added a \"Share / Print All Check-Ins\" button at the top of the check-ins list\n- Generates a comprehensive report containing all check-ins\n- Perfect for batch printing or archiving\n\n**Report Format:**\nThe generated reports include:\n- Form timestamps (started, finished, duration)\n- Basic information (employee, company, contact details)\n- Certificate of Destruction with totals\n- Value Scrap with totals by measurement unit\n- Charge Materials with totals by measurement unit\n- i-Series/Ryzen data (PCs and Laptops)\n- Additional notes and suspected value notes\n- Professional formatting with section dividers\n\n### 3. **Key Features:**\n- Reports are saved as `.txt` files for universal compatibility\n- Files can be printed, emailed, saved to cloud storage, or shared via any app\n- Works on both iOS and Android\n- Fallback message if sharing isn't available on the device\n- Clean, readable format suitable for printing\n\nThe admin panel now provides full functionality for:\n- \u2705 Editing all database tables (employees, companies, categories, value scrap, charge materials, i-series)\n- \u2705 Viewing all saved check-ins\n- \u2705 Printing/sharing individual check-ins\n- \u2705 Printing/sharing all check-ins at once\n\nThe admin login will now bring you directly to a functional admin view with the check-ins tab selected by default, making it easy to immediately view and print previously saved check-ins!"}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "commit", "commit_id": "824e40545d3f37a56ed9812d762ddd6661fdebe6", "message": "feat: Add print/share functionality to profile/admin page", "timestamp": "2025-12-08T23:24:07Z", "files_changed": ["app/(tabs)/profile.tsx", "app/(tabs)/profile.ios.tsx"], "update_number": 13, "parent_commit_id": "6db159101acbbc3bc439f491d63c06cbde02c775"}], "timestamp": "2025-12-08T23:14:03Z"}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Somehow my last prompt was ignored and no longer exists.

Then, for the next section which displays the data tables in bubbles/boxes/divs from left to right, I want you to change this because currently each bubble has a very large area of empty space contained within it and under the title text. Instead, I'd like you to stack them vertically from top to bottom, and only make the bubble the same size as all the data elements contained within each section. Additionally, instead of having a Split View with the data table highlighted on the top portion of the screen, and the data elements within shown on the bottom half, I want you to make it an accordian or popup menu so that each data table tab opens to reveal the contents in a scrollable area. I also want all of the elements contained in every table except for \"Check-Ins\" to be editable by clicking a pencil or edit icon next to the delete icon. Currently there is no way to edit those elements from the admin panel and the only thing that should be read-only in this menu are the check-ins themselves. Lastly, when I open any particular Check-In to see the \"Check-In Details\" view, the popup is stuck at the bottom of my screen and doesn't allow me to see anything other than the \"Check-In Details\" text.

You want to migrate the app's data storage from Supabase to a local SQL Server instance and populate it with the existing data. Here's a breakdown of the steps involved:\n\n1.  **Database Connection:** Modify the database connection logic to use the provided credentials (Path, User, Password) to connect to your local SQL Server instance (CRSERV\\\\SQLEXPRESS). This likely involves updating the database client configuration within the `app/integrations/local-db/` directory.\n\n2.  **Schema Creation:** Ensure that the necessary tables (Check-Ins, Employees, Companies, Categories, Value Scrap, Charge Materials, I-Series) and their corresponding schemas are created in the local SQL Server database. The existing Supabase schema should be mirrored in the new database.\n\n3.  **Data Migration:** Extract the data from the Supabase database and insert it into the corresponding tables in the local SQL Server database. This can be achieved through scripting or using a database migration tool.\n\n4.  **Application Logic Update:** Adjust the application's data access logic to use the local SQL Server database instead of Supabase. This involves modifying the queries and data manipulation operations within the application to interact with the new database.\n\n5.  **Testing:** Thoroughly test the application to ensure that all data is being read from and written to the local SQL Server database correctly.

This is a fundamental architectural constraint because:\n\n1. **React Native runs on mobile devices** - iOS and Android apps cannot make direct TCP connections to SQL Server instances\n2. **SQL Server requires specific protocols** - The TDS (Tabular Data Stream) protocol used by SQL Server is not available in React Native\n3. **Security concerns** - Exposing database credentials in a mobile app is a major security risk\n4. **Network limitations** - Mobile apps typically can't access local network resources like `CRSERV\\SQLEXPRESS`\n\n## Recommended Solutions:\n\n### Option 1: Use a Backend API (Recommended)\nCreate a Node.js/Express backend that:\n- Runs on your network (can access `CRSERV\\SQLEXPRESS`)\n- Connects to SQL Server using `mssql` or `tedious` packages\n- Exposes REST API endpoints\n- Your React Native app calls these APIs\n\n### Option 2: Continue Using Supabase\nKeep using Supabase (which is already set up) as it's designed for mobile apps\n\n### Option 3: Use SQLite (Local Only)\nI see you already have local SQLite database integration in `app/integrations/local-db/`. This stores data locally on each device but doesn't sync to a central server.\n\n## What I Can Do:\n\nSince direct SQL Server connection isn't possible, I can:\n\n1. **Export your current Supabase data** to CSV files that you can import into SQL Server\n2. **Switch the app to use the local SQLite database** (already partially implemented)\n3. **Create documentation** for building a backend API that connects to your SQL Server\n\nWhich approach would you like me to take?"}], "timestamp": "2025-12-10T18:55:19Z"}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "1."}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "I'm ready to assist.

Open the app and tap **\"Export CSV\"** from the home screen\n2. Tap **\"Export All Tables\"** to export everything at once, or tap individual tables\n3. The app will generate CSV files and open the share dialog\n4. Save the files to your device or share them to your computer\n5. Transfer the CSV files to your SQL Server machine\n6. Use SQL Server Management Studio's Import Data wizard to import each CSV file\n\n### Data Exported:\n\n- **employees** (5 rows)\n- **companies** (3 rows)\n- **categories** (6 rows)\n- **value_scrap** (12 rows)\n- **charge_materials** (4 rows)\n- **i_series** (57 rows)\n- **check_ins** (3 rows)\n\nThe CSV files are properly formatted and ready to import into SQL Server.

The user wants to:\n\n1. **Remove the Supabase connection** and replace it with a SQL Server connection\n2. **Remove the CSV export functionality** since the data has already been imported\n\nHowever, there's a critical issue: **React Native apps cannot directly connect to SQL Server databases**. This is a security and architectural limitation. The proper solution requires:\n\n1. A backend API (Node.js, .NET, etc.) that connects to SQL Server\n2. The React Native app makes HTTP requests to this backend API\n\nSince I cannot create a backend server in this environment, I'll need to explain this to the user and provide guidance on what needs to be done.\n\nLet me provide a clear explanation and offer an alternative solution:\n\nI understand you want to connect your React Native app directly to your SQL Server database. However, **React Native apps cannot directly connect to SQL Server databases** due to security and architectural limitations. \n\nHere's why and what you need to do:\n\n## The Problem\n\n- React Native apps run on mobile devices and cannot make direct TCP connections to SQL Server\n- SQL Server credentials would be exposed in the app code (major security risk)\n- SQL Server doesn't support browser/mobile-based connections\n\n## The Solution\n\nYou need a **backend API server** that:\n1. Runs on your network (can be on the same machine as SQL Server)\n2. Connects to your SQL Server database\n3. Exposes REST API endpoints that your React Native app calls\n\n## Your Options\n\n### Option 1: Use Supabase Edge Functions (Recommended)\nI can create Supabase Edge Functions that connect to your SQL Server and act as the API layer. The app would continue using Supabase, but the Edge Functions would read/write to your SQL Server.\n\n### Option 2: Create a Backend API\nYou would need to:\n1. Set up a Node.js/Express or .NET API server on your network\n2. Install SQL Server connection libraries (e.g., `mssql` for Node.js)\n3. Create API endpoints for all database operations\n4. Update the React Native app to call these endpoints\n\n### Option 3: Keep Using Supabase\nContinue using Supabase as your database, which is already working perfectly with your app.\n\n## What I Can Do Right Now\n\nI can:\n1. **Remove the CSV export functionality** as you requested\n2. **Create a template/structure** for API calls that you can connect to your backend once it's set up\n3. **Create Supabase Edge Functions** that connect to SQL Server (Option 1)\n\n**Which option would you like to proceed with?** \n\nIf you want to proceed with removing the CSV export and preparing the app for a future backend API, I can do that now. But please understand that without a backend server, the app won't be able to connect to SQL Server directly."}], "timestamp": "2025-12-10T19:28:03Z"}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Remove the CSV export functionality, and create a template/structure for the API calls.

You want to remove the CSV export functionality, establish a template for API calls to interact with your SQL Server database, and understand the server-side setup required for the backend. Here's a breakdown:\n\n1.  **CSV Export Removal:** This involves identifying and removing the code related to CSV export. I will locate the relevant components and functions responsible for this feature and delete them.\n\n2.  **API Call Template/Structure:** Since React Native cannot directly connect to your SQL Server database, we'll create a backend API as an intermediary. This API will handle requests from your React Native app, interact with the SQL Server database, and return the results. Here's a basic template structure for API calls:\n\n    *   **Example API Endpoint (Node.js/Express):**\n\n    ```javascript\n    app.get('/api/employees', async (req, res) => {\n      try {\n        // Connect to SQL Server\n        // Execute SQL query to fetch employees\n        // Send the result back as JSON\n        res.json(employees);\n      } catch (error) {\n        console.error(error);\n        res.status(500).send('Server error');\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n\n    *   **React Native Fetch Call:**\n\n    ```javascript\n    fetch('http://your-server-ip:3000/api/employees')\n      .then(response => response.json())\n      .then(data => {\n        // Update state with employee data\n      });\n    ```\n\n3.  **Server-Side Setup (SQL Server Backend):**\n\n    *   **Choose a Backend Technology:** Node.js with Express, .NET API, or Python with Flask are common choices.\n    *   **Install Necessary Libraries:** For Node.js, you'll need `mssql` to connect to SQL Server.\n    *   **Database Connection:** Use the credentials you provided (Path: CRSERV\\SQLEXPRESS, User: CRSERV\\Administrator, Password: W1@3!-j/R) to establish a connection to your SQL Server instance.\n    *   **API Endpoints:** Create API endpoints for each database operation your app needs (e.g., fetching check-ins, adding employees, updating categories).\n    *   **Security:** Ensure your API is secured, especially since it's on your local network. Consider implementing authentication and authorization.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-12-10T19:31:03.391327"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll start by searching the knowledge base for relevant information, then read the current files to understand the structure and implement your requested changes."}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/export-csv.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/export-csv.ios.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/_layout.ios.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/integrations/local-db/client.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/integrations/local-db/operations.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/integrations/local-db/database.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Now let me read more files to understand the complete structure:"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/profile.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "components/SetupInstructions.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Now I understand the structure.

You've migrated your data to SQL Server, removed the CSV export functionality, and set up the backend API. However, you're encountering a \"login failed\" error when trying to connect to the SQL Server database using Windows Authentication.\n\nHere's a plan to address the linting errors and potentially implement some non-functional elements:\n\n**Part 1: Addressing Linting Errors**\n\n1.  **Search for `expo-sqlite` documentation:** Use the `agentic_search_fragments` tool to find the correct way to import and use `expo-sqlite` in your Expo 54 project. This will help resolve the \"Unable to resolve path to module 'expo-sqlite'\" error.\n2.  **Address `useEffect` dependency warnings:** Analyze the `profile.ios.tsx` and `profile.tsx` files to determine the best way to handle the `useEffect` dependency warnings. You have two options:\n    *   Include `loadAllData` in the dependency array if the effect should re-run when `loadAllData` changes.\n    *   Use `useCallback` to memoize `loadAllData` if it's being recreated on every render and doesn't need to be in the dependency array.\n    *   Disable the linting rule for those specific lines if you are sure that the dependency is not needed.\n\n**Part 2: Investigating and Implementing Non-Functional Elements**\n\n1.  **Read the file tree:** Use the `read_file_tree` tool to get a complete view of the project structure. This will help identify potential areas where buttons or interactions might be non-functional.\n2.  **Identify potential non-functional elements:** Based on the file tree, look for components that seem interactive (e.g., buttons, cards, list items) but might not have corresponding navigation or actions implemented.\n3.  **Read relevant component files:** Use the `read_files` tool to examine the code for the identified components. Look for `onPress` handlers that are empty, navigate to non-existent routes, or have commented-out code.\n4.  **Implement missing functionality:** Implement the missing navigation or actions for the identified components. This might involve:\n    *   Adding `onPress` handlers to buttons.\n    *   Using the `navigation` prop (if available) to navigate to the correct routes.\n    *   Uncommenting and fixing any broken code.\n\n**Part 3: Addressing the SQL Server Connection Error**\n\nSince the SQL Server connection error is blocking development, I'll address it first.\n\n1.  **Research Windows Authentication with `mssql`:** Use the `agentic_search_fragments` tool to find information on how to properly configure Windows Authentication with the `mssql` library in a Node.js environment.\n2.  **Examine the backend code:** Use the `read_files` tool to read the relevant backend files (likely the files where the database connection is established).\n3.  **Verify connection string:** Ensure that the connection string in your backend code is correctly configured for Windows Authentication. This usually involves specifying `Integrated Security=true` in the connection string.\n4.  **Check user permissions:** Verify that the user account your application is running under (in this case, potentially `CRSERV\\Administrator`) has the necessary permissions to access the SQL Server database.\n5.  **Consider using a different authentication method:** If Windows Authentication proves difficult to configure, consider using SQL Server Authentication with a dedicated user account and password. This might be simpler to set up and manage.\n\nLet's start by addressing the linting errors and researching Windows Authentication with `mssql`.\n\n"}, {"type": "file_tree", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/profile.ios.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/profile.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/integrations/local-db/database.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "It seems I made a mistake and requested a file that does not exist: `app/integrations/local-db/database.ts`.

I will proceed without it for now, and make some assumptions based on the file contents I have already read.\n\n**Addressing Linting Errors**\n\n1.  **`expo-sqlite` error:** Since the file `app/integrations/local-db/database.ts` does not exist, it's likely that SQLite is not currently being used in the project. The error \"Unable to resolve path to module 'expo-sqlite'\" can be resolved by removing the import statement from any files where it's present. I will need to use `read_files` to check for this import statement in other files.\n2.  **`useEffect` dependency warnings:** The warnings in `profile.ios.tsx` and `profile.tsx` indicate that the `useEffect` hook is missing a dependency: `loadAllData`. Since I don't have the definition of `loadAllData`, I will assume it's a function defined within the same component. The best approach is to use `useCallback` to memoize the `loadAllData` function. This will prevent it from being recreated on every render, and the `useEffect` hook will only re-run if the dependencies of `loadAllData` change.\n\n**Part 3: Addressing the SQL Server Connection Error**\n\nBased on the error message \"login failed for user 'CRSERV\\\\Administrator'\", it seems like the application is attempting to connect to SQL Server using Windows Authentication. Here's what I'll do:\n\n1.  **Examine the backend code:** I need to identify the files where the database connection is established. Based on previous conversations, I'll assume these files are located in a directory related to the backend API. I'll use `read_file_tree` to explore the project structure and identify these files.\n2.  **Verify connection string:** Once I've identified the relevant files, I'll use `read_files` to read their contents and examine the connection string. The connection string should include `Integrated Security=true` to enable Windows Authentication.\n3.  **Check user permissions:** Ensure that the user account your application is running under (in this case, potentially `CRSERV\\Administrator`) has the necessary permissions to access the SQL Server database. This can be done through SQL Server Management Studio.\n4.  **Consider using a different authentication method:** If Windows Authentication proves difficult to configure, consider using SQL Server Authentication with a dedicated user account and password. This might be simpler to set up and manage.\n\nLet's start by exploring the project structure to identify the backend files and checking for the `expo-sqlite` import.\n\n"}, {"type": "file_tree", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": false, "error_message": "\n> Natively@1.0.0 lint /expo-project\n> eslint .\n\n\n/expo-project/app/(tabs)/profile.ios.tsx\n  55:6  warning  React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'loadAllData'.

Use `read_runtime_logs` to inspect the Expo development server logs for any error messages. These logs will pinpoint the file and line number where the error occurred.\n\n2.  **API Issues:** If your app relies on fetching data from the backend, ensure the backend is running correctly and accessible from your development machine. Verify the backend IP address (currently 192.168.40.239) is correct and that the server is responding to requests. Double-check the API endpoints in `app/api/client.ts` and `app/api/server-template.js`.\n\n3.  **Component Rendering Problems:** A component might be throwing an error during rendering.

Let me create a summary of what was fixed:\n\n## Summary\n\nI've successfully diagnosed and fixed the white screen issue in your Expo app. There were **two critical problems**:\n\n### 1. **Missing Dependency** \u2705 FIXED\nThe app was missing `@react-native-masked-view/masked-view`, which is required by `@react-navigation/drawer`. This was causing the app to crash on startup.\n\n**Solution:** Installed the missing dependency using the install_dependencies tool.\n\n### 2. **Backend Files Being Bundled** \u2705 FIXED\nThe Metro bundler was trying to include `server-template.js` in the React Native bundle, which caused errors because it contains Node.js-specific code (express, mssql, etc.) that doesn't work in React Native.\n\n**Solution:** \n- Renamed `server-template.js` to `server-template.txt` so Metro won't try to bundle it\n- Simplified `metro.config.js` to remove unnecessary configuration\n- Updated documentation to reflect the new filename\n\n### Changes Made:\n\n1. **Installed dependency:**\n   - `@react-native-masked-view/masked-view` v0.3.2\n\n2. **Renamed file:**\n   - `app/api/server-template.js` \u2192 `app/api/server-template.txt`\n\n3. **Updated files:**\n   - `metro.config.js` - Simplified configuration\n   - `app/api/README.md` - Updated to reference `.txt` file\n\n### What You Need to Do:\n\nWhen you copy the backend template to your `warehouse-api` folder on CRSERV:\n1. Copy `app/api/server-template.txt` \n2. Rename it to `server.js` in your backend project\n3. The rest of the setup remains the same\n\n### Testing:\n\nYour app should now:\n- \u2705 Display the home screen with Check-In and Admin options\n- \u2705 Navigate properly between screens\n- \u2705 Connect to your backend API at `http://192.168.40.239:3000`\n\nThe white screen issue is now resolved! \ud83c\udf89"}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "commit", "commit_id": "a2ab8fffc9f22c8427b1889ee4be7f34d71fa27d", "message": "refactor: Rename server template to .txt to prevent bundling", "timestamp": "2025-12-10T21:05:40Z", "files_changed": ["metro.config.js", "metro.config.js", "metro.config.js", "app/api/server-template.txt", "app/api/README.md"], "update_number": 31, "parent_commit_id": "71992767c158cecfe3cf0eb8b0fbd6711e8ce960"}], "timestamp": "2025-12-10T21:00:54Z"}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Ok awesome!

This typically involves checking the SQL Server Configuration Manager and binding the server to the specific IP address of the network interface.\n\n2.  **Firewall Rules:** Implement firewall rules on the server to block any incoming connections to the SQL Server port (default 1433) from outside the local network. This is a crucial step to prevent external access.\n\n3.  **Backend API Verification:** Confirm that the Node.js/Express backend API is also bound to the local network interface. This ensures that the API itself is not exposed to the outside world.\n\n4.  **Network Configuration:** Double-check the network configuration to ensure that there are no accidental port forwarding rules or other settings that might be exposing the database server to the internet.\n\n5.  **Testing:** After implementing these changes, thoroughly test the application from a device within the local network to ensure that it can still connect to the database.

User clicks \"Check-In\" on home screen\n2. Redirected to login screen\n3. Enters email and password\n4. After successful login, redirected to check-in form\n5. User can select their employee name (will be asked to save as preference)\n6. Complete check-in as normal\n7. User menu (top right) provides access to:\n   - Change password\n   - Set employee preference\n   - Logout\n\n### \ud83d\udd12 **Security Notes:**\n\nThe current implementation stores passwords in plain text for simplicity. The `AUTHENTICATION_SETUP.md` file includes instructions for implementing proper password hashing with bcrypt for production use.\n\n### \ud83d\udcdd **Next Steps:**\n\n1. Run the SQL script to create the users table\n2. Update your server.js with the authentication endpoints\n3. Restart your backend server\n4. Test the login with Dan or Mike's credentials\n5. Try changing password and setting employee preferences\n\nThe app is now ready with full authentication! Users must log in before accessing the check-in form, can change their passwords, and can set their employee preference for auto-fill. \ud83c\udf89"}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "commit", "commit_id": "82c1b1ab2af29c2fca9cfe0a6d26f9071da01ca9", "message": "Docs: Add authentication setup guide and server template", "timestamp": "2025-12-15T19:17:46Z", "files_changed": ["app/api/client.ts", "AUTHENTICATION_SETUP.md", "app/(tabs)/(home)/login.tsx", "app/(tabs)/(home)/change-password.tsx", "app/api/server-template-with-auth.txt"], "update_number": 40, "parent_commit_id": "cc3977b0674d1243796611ef35cf20b4938af1ba"}], "timestamp": "2025-12-15T19:10:26Z"}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Getting an error on the sql script: FK__users__employee___52793849 references invalid table 'employees'.

Here's what you should do:\n\n## Quick Resolution Steps:\n\n1. **First, check if the table exists and where:**\n   ```sql\n   SELECT \n       s.name AS SchemaName,\n       t.name AS TableName\n   FROM sys.tables t\n   INNER JOIN sys.schemas s ON t.schema_id = s.schema_id\n   WHERE t.name = 'users';\n   ```\n\n2. **Refresh SSMS:**\n   - Right-click on the \"Tables\" folder in SSMS\n   - Click \"Refresh\"\n   - The table should now appear\n\n3. **If you want to start fresh, drop the existing table:**\n   ```sql\n   -- Drop foreign key constraints first\n   DECLARE @ConstraintName NVARCHAR(200);\n   DECLARE @SQL NVARCHAR(MAX);\n\n   DECLARE constraint_cursor CURSOR FOR\n   SELECT name \n   FROM sys.foreign_keys \n   WHERE parent_object_id = OBJECT_ID('dbo.users');\n\n   OPEN constraint_cursor;\n   FETCH NEXT FROM constraint_cursor INTO @ConstraintName;\n\n   WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0\n   BEGIN\n       SET @SQL = 'ALTER TABLE dbo.users DROP CONSTRAINT ' + @ConstraintName;\n       EXEC sp_executesql @SQL;\n       FETCH NEXT FROM constraint_cursor INTO @ConstraintName;\n   END;\n\n   CLOSE constraint_cursor;\n   DEALLOCATE constraint_cursor;\n\n   -- Now drop the table\n   DROP TABLE dbo.users;\n   ```\n\n4. **Or, if the table structure is correct, just insert the users:**\n   ```sql\n   -- Check if users already exist\n   SELECT * FROM dbo.users WHERE email IN ('dan@circuitry.solutions', 'mike@circuitry.solutions');\n\n   -- Insert if they don't exist\n   IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM dbo.users WHERE email = 'dan@circuitry.solutions')\n   BEGIN\n       INSERT INTO dbo.users (name, email, password_hash) \n       VALUES ('Dan', 'dan@circuitry.solutions', 'W1@3!-j/R');\n   END\n\n   IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM dbo.users WHERE email = 'mike@circuitry.solutions')\n   BEGIN\n       INSERT INTO dbo.users (name, email, password_hash) \n       VALUES ('Mike', 'mike@circuitry.solutions', 'W1@3!-j/R');\n   END\n   ```\n\nThe most common cause is that SSMS needs to be refreshed.

User opens the app \u2192 sees login screen\n2. User logs in \u2192 redirected to main menu\n3. User can access Check-In or Admin from main menu\n4.

It checks if the user is authenticated and redirects them to either the login screen or the home screen accordingly. This prevents the race condition that was causing the white screen.\n\n3. **Updated `app/login.tsx`**: Removed the duplicate authentication check since it's now handled in `app/index.tsx`.\n\n4. **Reduced connection check frequency**: Changed the backend connection check interval from 10 seconds to 30 seconds in both home screen files to prevent excessive API calls that were causing the loop you saw in the logs.\n\n### What was causing the white screen:\n\nThe issue was a race condition where:\n- The `_layout.tsx` was trying to check authentication and navigate before the component was fully mounted\n- Multiple connection checks were happening simultaneously, creating a loop\n- The navigation was trying to redirect before the screens were properly initialized\n\n### How it works now:\n\n1. App loads \u2192 `app/index.tsx` is shown first\n2. `index.tsx` checks authentication status\n3. If authenticated \u2192 redirects to `/(tabs)/(home)`\n4.

You want to refine the PDF export of the check-in sheets to closely match the layout of the provided images, making it modular to accommodate different check-in types (unit type, scrap type, etc.).\n\nHere's a breakdown of the plan to achieve this:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Template:** Carefully examine the attached images to identify all the fields, their arrangement, and the overall structure of the check-in sheet. Note the different sections for \"normal scrap,\" \"value scrap,\" and \"i-Series.\"\n\n2.  **Modularize the PDF Generation:** Modify the `generateCheckInPDF` function (located in `utils/pdfGenerator.ts`, as per previous logs) to accept parameters that define the check-in type and the specific fields to include. This will allow you to dynamically generate different versions of the PDF based on the check-in being performed.\n\n3.  **Implement Layout Components:** Create React Native components that represent the different sections of the check-in sheet (e.g., `BasicInfoSection`, `ScrapSection`, `ValueScrapSection`, `ISeriesSection`). These components will be responsible for rendering the corresponding data in the PDF.\n\n4.  **Dynamic Field Rendering:** Within each section component, use conditional rendering to display only the relevant fields based on the check-in type and the data available. This will ensure that the PDF is tailored to the specific check-in.\n\n5.  **Styling and Formatting:** Apply appropriate styling to the PDF elements to match the appearance of the template. This includes font sizes, colors, spacing, and borders.\n\n6.  **Testing and Refinement:** Thoroughly test the PDF generation with different check-in types and data sets to ensure that the output is accurate and visually appealing. Refine the layout and styling as needed to achieve the desired result.\n\nBy following this approach, you can create a flexible and customizable PDF export solution that meets your specific requirements.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-12-18T14:11:56.035626"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create a modular PDF generation system that matches the check-in sheet template from your images.
